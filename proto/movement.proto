    Acts to (re)move an entry.

    When dest is unset (=0) then a Movement acts to remove an Entry.

    When dest is set to a time in the past, effectively moves an entry to another location.
    When dest is set to a time in the future, hides the entry until that future time arrives.

    When dest is set to -1, hide indefinately (may be visible in queries that show future).

    Should only be used for positional containers (i.e. DIRECTORY or REGISTRY).
    For keyed containers, just add a new entry setting deleting = True.
