# Overview

Gink is a versioned, eventually consistent, multi-paradigm database management system.
It takes a "protocol-first" approach, which facilitates multiple implementations
that can share data.  This repository contains the protocol buffer definitions for the
syncronization protocol, as well as two reference implementations: one in Typescript and
the other in Python.
